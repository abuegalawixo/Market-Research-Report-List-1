<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open Loop Current Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Isolated</li><li>Non-Isolated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The open loop current sensor market is segmented into two main types: isolated and non-isolated sensors. Isolated sensors provide electrical separation between the sensing device and the measured circuit, enhancing safety and reducing noise interference, making them suitable for high-voltage applications. In contrast, non-isolated sensors do not offer this separation, resulting in a more straightforward design and lower cost, but may be limited in high-voltage scenarios. Both types cater to various industrial, automotive, and consumer electronics applications.</p></p>
