<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Damper Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HVAC damper actuator market comprises two main types: non-spring return and spring return damper actuators. Non-spring return actuators are designed to maintain their position when power is lost, providing energy efficiency and consistent airflow control. In contrast, spring return actuators automatically revert to a default position when de-energized, ensuring safety and system reliability. Both types play crucial roles in optimizing HVAC system performance, regulating air distribution, and enhancing indoor comfort in residential and commercial applications.</p></p>
