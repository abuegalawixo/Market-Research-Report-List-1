<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glucose Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucose Oxidase Method</li><li>Glucose Dehydrogenase Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glucose meter market is primarily divided into two types based on the enzymatic methods used for glucose measurement: the Glucose Oxidase Method and the Glucose Dehydrogenase Method. The Glucose Oxidase Method employs the enzyme glucose oxidase to catalyze the oxidation of glucose, producing hydrogen peroxide, which is then measured. In contrast, the Glucose Dehydrogenase Method uses glucose dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in the presence of cofactors, resulting in a more stable and accurate reading. Both methods cater to different user needs and preferences in diabetes management.</p></p>
