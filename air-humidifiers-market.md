<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Humidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vapor Type Air Humidifiers</li><li>Water Spray Air Humidifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air humidifiers market is primarily divided into two main types: vapor type air humidifiers and water spray air humidifiers. Vapor type air humidifiers, often categorized as steam vaporizers, heat water to produce steam, which is then cooled before being released into the air, providing effective humidity control. In contrast, water spray air humidifiers utilize a pump to create fine water droplets that are emitted into the air, directly increasing humidity levels without heating the water. Both types enhance indoor air quality and comfort.</p></p>
