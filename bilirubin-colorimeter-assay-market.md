<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bilirubin Colorimeter Assay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conjugated Bilirubin (Direct Bilirubin)</li><li>Unconjugated Bilirubin (Indirect Bilirubin)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bilirubin Colorimeter Assay market is segmented into two main types: Conjugated Bilirubin (direct bilirubin) and Unconjugated Bilirubin (indirect bilirubin). Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and typically results from liver processing of bilirubin, indicating liver function and bile duct health. Unconjugated bilirubin, on the other hand, is fat-soluble and reflects the breakdown of hemoglobin, serving as an indicator of hemolysis or liver dysfunction. These two assays are essential in diagnosing various hepatic and hematologic conditions.</p></p>
