<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kidney (Renal) Fibrosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angiotensin Converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors</li><li>Pirfenidone</li><li>Renin Inhibitors</li><li>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)</li><li>Vasopeptidase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The kidney fibrosis market includes several therapeutic classes that target the progression of renal fibrosis. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) help reduce hypertension and kidney damage by blocking renin-angiotensin pathways. Renin inhibitors directly inhibit renin activity, further mitigating fibrosis. Pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent that slows down tissue scarring. Vasopeptidase inhibitors combine the effects of ACE inhibitors and neutral endopeptidase inhibition, aiming to enhance renal protection and reduce fibrosis progression effectively.</p></p>
